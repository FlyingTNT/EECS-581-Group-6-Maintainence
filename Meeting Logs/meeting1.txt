WHEN: Tuesday, September 11th @ 8:30 pm
PURPOSE: First team meeting, setting our environment
ATTENDANCE: Gavin Billinger (virtually), Bisshoy Battacharjee, Joshua Welicky, Mark Kitchin, Maximilian Biundo

We spent the meeting first setting up a consistent meeting time for the future. We decided tentatively to set up our meetings at 12:15 on Tuesday in Eaton. Then we moved our Scrum meetings to 10 am on Friday.

Next, we set up our GitHub repository and put together a plan in Microsoft Planner. Bisshoy, Joshua, and Mark will lay out project requirements while Max, Gavin, and Mark (again) will look into the design specifics of the Minesweeper program.
We also decided our coding environment would be Python. Then, we broke for the evening.
